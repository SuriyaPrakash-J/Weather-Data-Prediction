# Weather Data Prediction 🌦️

This project focuses on predicting weather conditions based on historical weather data using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of multiple regression models to make accurate predictions.

# 📁 Project Structure

*Weather_Data_Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire process from data loading to prediction.
*weatherHistory.csv (assumed): Dataset used for the analysis and prediction (source: historical weather data).
*Output graphs: Visualizations of the relationships between features and target variables.

# 🔧 Requirements

*Make sure the following libraries are installed:
*pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# 🚀 How to Run

*Clone the repository or download the notebook.
*Make sure the dataset (weatherHistory.csv) is available in the same directory.
*Open the notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
*Run all cells to see the full workflow and prediction results.
